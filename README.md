## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ndegwadavid/CEMA-Health.git
cd CEMA-Health
```

2. Set up the backend:
```
cd backend
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

4. Setup the mailpit server

```
on terminal run ðŸ‘‡
./mailpit
{if installed}
If not instructions to install found online.
```
## Install mailpit
https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/install/

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Enrollment ID System

The system generates unique enrollment IDs for clients based on the short code of the program they're enrolled in. For example:

- Program with short code "HIV" would generate enrollment IDs like: 
HIV/2025/W4CMaCid,
- Program with short code "BTN" would generate enrollment IDs like: 
BTN/2025/W4CMaCid

This allows for easy identification of which program a client is enrolled in just by looking at their enrollment ID.

## Security Considerations

HealthConnect prioritizes data security and patient privacy:
- All API requests require authentication
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Login activity monitoring with email notifications
- Compliance with healthcare data protection standards
- Secure API-based data transmission
